Version: 0.1.0
Author: Topias Karjalainen
Maintainer: The package maintainer <topias.karjalainen@helsinki.fi>
Description: Spotify API thing. Since a pure wrapper already exists, I'm just 
going to make this a thing that you can use to analyze your tracks and perhaps 
make new playlists based on certain criteria. Who knows.
