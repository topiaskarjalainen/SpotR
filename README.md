# SpotR
SpotR is going to be a set of tools for interacting with Spotify api. 
Created mainly because of my need to backup my playlists.

Since a pure wrapper already exists, I'm just 
going to make this a thing that you can use to analyze your tracks and perhaps 
make new playlists based on certain criteria. Who knows.
