# SpotR
SpotR is going to be a set of tools for interacting with Spotify api. Created mainly because of my need to backup my playlists.

This is my first proper R project. It is fairly new and it doesn't really have any features yet(basically just the authentiation part), but I plan to expand it as my schechule permits.
